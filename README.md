# DocQuery: Document Query Engine Powered by Large Language Models

</div>

DocQuery is a library and command-line tool that makes it easy to analyze semi-structured and unstructured documents (PDFs, scanned
images, etc.) using large language models (LLMs). You simply point DocQuery at one or more documents and specify a
question you want to ask. DocQuery is created by the team at [Impira](https://impira.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docquery). This version is implemented by pinkthepink

## Quickstart (CLI)

To install `docquery 0.7.1`, you can simply run the following code:

'''sh
git clone https://github.com/pinkthepink/docquery-updated.git
apt-get install poppler-utils
cd docquery && pip install .[all]
'''

This will install the command line tool as well as the library.
If you want to run OCR on images, then you must also install the [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) library:


- Ubuntu:

  ```sh
  apt install tesseract-ocr
  ```

`docquery` scan allows you to ask one or more questions to a single document or directory of files. For example, you can
find the invoice number <https://templates.invoicehome.com/invoice-template-us-neat-750px.png> with:

```bash
docquery scan "What is the invoice number?" https://templates.invoicehome.com/invoice-template-us-neat-750px.png
```

If you have a folder of documents on your machine, you can run something like

```bash
docquery scan "What is the effective date?" /path/to/contracts/folder
```

to determine the effective date of every document in the folder.

## Quickstart (Library)

DocQuery can also be used as a library. It contains two basic abstractions: (1) a `DocumentQuestionAnswering` pipeline
that makes it simple to ask questions of documents and (2) a `Document` abstraction that can parse various types of documents
to feed into the pipeline.

```python
>>> from docquery import document, pipeline
>>> p = pipeline('document-question-answering')
>>> doc = document.load_document("/path/to/document.pdf")
>>> for q in ["What is the invoice number?", "What is the invoice total?"]:
...     print(q, p(question=q, **doc.context))
```

## Use cases

DocQuery excels at a number of use cases involving structured, semi-structured, or unstructured documents. You can ask questions about
invoices, contracts, forms, emails, letters, receipts, and many more. You can also classify documents. We will continue evolving the model,
offer more modeling options, and expanding the set of supported documents. We welcome feedback, requests, and of course contributions to
help achieve this vision.

## How it works

Under the hood, docquery uses a pre-trained zero-shot language model, based on [LayoutLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13318), that has been
fine-tuned for a question-answering task. The model is trained using a combination of [SQuAD2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)
and [DocVQA](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=17) which make it particularly well suited for complex visual question answering tasks on
a wide variety of documents. The underlying model is also published on HuggingFace as [impira/layoutlm-document-qa](https://huggingface.co/impira/layoutlm-document-qa)
which you can access directly.

## Limitations

DocQuery is intended to have a small install footprint and be simple to work with. As a result, it has some limitations:

- Models must be pre-trained. Although DocQuery uses a zero-shot model that can adapt based on the question you provide, it does not learn from your data.
- Support for images and PDFs. Currently DocQuery supports images and PDFs, with or without embedded text. It does not support word documents, emails, spreadsheets, etc.
- Scalar text outputs. DocQuery only produces text outputs (answers). It does not support richer scalar types (i.e. it treats numbers and dates as strings) or tables.

## Advanced features

### Using Donut üç©

If you'd like to test `docquery` with [Donut](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15664), you must install the required extras:

```bash
pip install docquery[donut]
```

You can then run

```bash
docquery scan "What is the effective date?" /path/to/contracts/folder --checkpoint 'naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa'
```

### Classifying documents

To classify documents, you simply add the `--classify` argument to `scan`. You can specify any [image classification](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=image-classification&sort=downloads)
model on Hugging Face's hub. By default, the classification pipeline uses [Donut](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/donut-rvlcdip) (which requires
the installation instructions above):

```bash

# Classify documents
docquery scan --classify  /path/to/contracts/folder --checkpoint 'naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa'

# Classify documents and ask a question too
docquery scan --classify "What is the effective date?" /path/to/contracts/folder --checkpoint 'naver-clova-ix/donut-base-finetuned-docvqa'
```

### Scraping webpages

DocQuery can read files through HTTP/HTTPs out of the box. However, if you want to read HTML documents, you can do that too by installing the
`[web]` extension. The extension uses the [webdriver-manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/) library which can install a Chrome
driver on your system automatically, but you'll need to make sure Chrome is installed globally.
